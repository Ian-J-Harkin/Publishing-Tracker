# Dalenii Publishing Tracker - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal**: Create a professional full-stack portfolio project to showcase modern development skills for job applications within 2-4 weeks.

**Problem**: Independent authors and small publishers need a centralized system to track eBook sales, royalty payments, and advertising spend across multiple platforms like Amazon KDP, IngramSpark, and Draft2Digital.

**Solution**: A modern web application built with React TypeScript frontend, .NET 8 Minimal API backend, and Azure cloud services.

## 📊 Strategic Value for Portfolio

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Modern CSS, Data Visualization
- **Backend**: .NET 8 Minimal APIs, Entity Framework Core, RESTful Design
- **Database**: SQL Server/Azure SQL, Code-First Migrations, Complex Queries
- **Cloud**: Azure App Service, SQL Database, Blob Storage, Functions, Key Vault
- **DevOps**: Git, GitHub Actions, CI/CD Pipelines, Automated Deployment
- **Security**: JWT Authentication, Managed Identity, Secure Configuration

### Business Impact Story
*"I built this application after working with Dalenii Digital and recognizing a real need in the independent publishing market. The application solves actual business problems while demonstrating my ability to translate business requirements into technical solutions."*

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Modern Full-Stack Design
```
React TypeScript SPA → .NET 8 Minimal API → Azure SQL Database
                    ↓
            Azure Blob Storage → Azure Functions (Background Processing)
                    ↓
            Azure Key Vault (Secure Configuration)
```

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Minimal APIs**: Demonstrates knowledge of latest .NET patterns
2. **React with TypeScript**: Market-demanded frontend skills
3. **Code-First EF Core**: Modern data access patterns
4. **Azure PaaS Services**: Cloud-native architecture
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Professional development workflow

## 📅 Implementation Timeline

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Week 1** | Foundation | .NET API + React Setup + Basic CRUD |
| **Week 2** | Core Features | Dashboard + Data Management + Authentication |
| **Week 3** | Advanced Features | CSV Import + UI Polish + Testing |
| **Week 4** | Cloud Deployment | Azure Migration + CI/CD + Documentation |

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

1. **Authentication**: Secure login/registration
2. **Dashboard**: Revenue overview, sales charts, key metrics
3. **Book Management**: Add/edit books, track performance
4. **Sales Tracking**: View detailed sales data, filter/sort
5. **Data Import**: Upload CSV files, view processing status
6. **Platform Analytics**: Compare performance across platforms

## 💼 Interview Talking Points

### Technical Architecture Discussion
- *"I chose .NET 8 Minimal APIs to demonstrate knowledge of the latest patterns while maintaining the performance and type safety that enterprises require."*
- *"The React TypeScript frontend uses functional components with hooks, showcasing modern React patterns that are in high demand."*
- *"I implemented Entity Framework Core with code-first migrations to show database design skills and migration management."*

### Problem-Solving Approach
- *"When designing the CSV import feature, I considered both immediate parsing and background processing patterns to prepare for Azure Functions integration."*
- *"The authentication system starts with JWT for local development but is designed to easily integrate with Azure AD for enterprise scenarios."*

### Cloud Architecture Understanding
- *"I structured the application to use Azure PaaS services like App Service and SQL Database, showing understanding of managed services vs. infrastructure management."*
- *"The use of Key Vault and Managed Identity demonstrates security best practices for cloud applications."*

### Business Acumen
- *"This project demonstrates my ability to understand business requirements and translate them into technical solutions that provide real value."*
