## üöÄ Implementation Strategy

### **Parallel Development Approach**

#### **Backend-First Tasks** (Can be developed independently)
- Authentication infrastructure (Days 1-2)
- Database models and migrations (Day 1)
- API endpoints for each feature
- CSV processing logic (Days 15-17)

#### **Frontend-First Tasks** (Can be developed with mock data)
- React component structure and routing
- Form components and validation
- Chart components and data visualization
- Mobile responsive layouts

#### **Integration Points** (Require both backend and frontend)
- Authentication flow testing
- End-to-end user workflows
- File upload and processing
- Real-time dashboard updates

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

#### **Technical Risks**
- **CSV Processing Complexity**: Start with simple CSV formats, expand to handle edge cases
- **Chart Performance**: Use optimized charting libraries, implement data pagination for large datasets
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Use CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap for faster development

#### **Timeline Risks**
- **Scope Creep**: Focus on MVP features first, advanced features are optional
- **Integration Issues**: Plan integration testing throughout development, not just at the end
- **Deployment Complexity**: Set up Azure environment early, test deployment process regularly

### **Quality Gates**

#### **End of Week 1**
- User can register, login, add books, and add sales manually
- Basic navigation and authentication flow works
- Database schema is stable and tested

#### **End of Week 2**
- Complete sales management and dashboard functionality
- Data visualization working with real data
- Core user workflows are smooth and bug-free

#### **End of Week 3**
- CSV import functionality fully operational
- Import history and error handling robust
- User profile management complete

#### **End of Week 4**
- Mobile-optimized experience across all features
- Production deployment successful and stable
- Application ready for portfolio demonstration
