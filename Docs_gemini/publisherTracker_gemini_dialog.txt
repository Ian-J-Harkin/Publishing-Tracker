As a software architecture specialist, I've reviewed the specification for the "Dalenii Publishing Tracker."


  This is an excellent and well-thought-out project specification. The concept is strong, authentic, and perfectly suited for a
  high-impact portfolio piece. The technology choices are modern, coherent, and highly relevant to your career goals, especially
   with the focus on Azure and the AZ-204 certification. The high-level architecture using a React SPA, .NET Minimal API, and an
   event-driven Azure Function for file processing is sound and demonstrates a grasp of modern cloud-native design.


  My recommendations will focus on making the specification more concrete by defining the specific features, data structures,
  and interactions between the components. Adding this next layer of detail will transform the concept into a professional-grade
   architectural blueprint, making the development process smoother and the final project significantly more impressive to a
  potential employer.

  Here are my suggestions on how to make it more specific.

  ---


  1. Define the Functional Requirements (User Stories)

  To move from a concept to a concrete plan, we need to define what a user can actually do. Defining a small set of core user
  stories will clarify the scope and drive the design of the database, API, and UI.


  Suggestion:
  I recommend defining a handful of core user stories to act as your Minimum Viable Product (MVP). For example:


   * "As an author, I want to securely sign up and log in to the application."
   * "As an author, I want to upload a KDP sales report CSV so that the sales data is automatically processed and added to my
     dashboard."
   * "As an author, I want to see a dashboard with my total earnings for the current month and a chart of sales over the past 30
     days."
   * "As an author, I want to manually enter my monthly advertising spend for different platforms (e.g., Facebook Ads, Amazon
     Ads) so I can calculate my overall profit."
   * "As an author, I want to see a list of all my books and view the detailed sales history for a specific book."

  2. Define the Core Data Model (The Schema)


  The data model is the backbone of the application. Defining the core entities upfront, based on your user stories, will
  clarify the entire system. Since you are using EF Core Code-First, these would be your initial C# entity classes.


  Suggestion:
  Based on the stories above, I would suggest starting with these core data entities:


   * Book: Id (int), Title (string), ASIN (string), AuthorId (string)
   * Sale: Id (int), SaleDate (DateTime), Marketplace (string), Royalty (decimal), BookId (int)
   * AdSpend: Id (int), Month (int), Year (int), Platform (string), Amount (decimal)
   * User: The user profile will likely be managed by an external identity provider, but you might have a local reference.


  3. Define the API Contract (The Endpoints)

  A clear API contract ensures the frontend and backend can be developed in parallel and communicate correctly. It's the formal
  agreement between your two services.

  Suggestion:
  Let's define the key RESTful endpoints needed to fulfill the user stories:


   * Authentication: Handled via an identity provider, but the API needs to be secured.
   * File Upload: POST /api/sales-reports - A secure endpoint that accepts a file upload and initiates the Azure Function
     workflow.
   * Dashboard: GET /api/dashboard/summary - Returns aggregated data for the main dashboard view (e.g., monthly earnings, recent
     sales trend data).
   * Books: GET /api/books and GET /api/books/{bookId}/sales - Standard CRUD-like endpoints to get book information and detailed
     sales data.
   * Advertising: POST /api/ad-spend and GET /api/ad-spend?month=X&year=Y - Endpoints to log new ad spend and retrieve it for
     profit calculation.

  4. Specify the User Authentication & Authorization Flow


  The specification mentions security, but we can make the flow explicit. For a modern SPA and API, a standard token-based flow
  is essential and a key skill to demonstrate.

  Suggestion:
  I recommend specifying the use of Azure AD B2C as the identity provider. This is highly relevant for the AZ-204 exam and
  demonstrates a key enterprise skill. The flow would be:


   1. The React app redirects the user to the Azure AD B2C hosted login page.
   2. After a successful login, the user is redirected back to the React app with a JWT (JSON Web Token).
   3. The React app stores this JWT securely and includes it in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header for all subsequent API
      calls.
   4. The .NET 8 Minimal API will be configured to validate this JWT on every incoming request to secure its endpoints.

  5. Specify the CI/CD Pipeline


  To showcase modern DevOps practices, the project should include automated builds and deployments. Explicitly defining this
  makes the project feel more professional.

  Suggestion:
  I recommend adding a section for CI/CD using GitHub Actions. A professional pipeline would have two workflows:


   1. Pull Request Workflow: On every pull request to the main branch, automatically build the .NET API and the React app, and
      run any unit/integration tests to ensure code quality before merging.
   2. Deploy to Azure Workflow: On every successful merge to the main branch, automatically deploy the API and the React
      frontend to their respective Azure App Services. This demonstrates a complete, automated "code-to-cloud" pipeline.


  By adding these specific details, you will elevate this from a strong concept to a professional-grade architectural
  specification that will be incredibly impressive in a portfolio.

  Part 4: The Capstone Solution: A High-Impact Portfolio Project

  To effectively showcase the newly acquired skills, a generic project like a to-do list or a simple blog is insufficient for a
  developer of Ian's seniority. The portfolio project must be credible, complex enough to be impressive, and authentic. It must
  serve as the central piece of evidence demonstrating mastery of the modern full-stack.

  4.1 Project Concept: "Dalenii Publishing Tracker"

  The ideal project concept is one that is rooted in a real-world problem domain. By creating an application based on the recent
  experience with Dalenii Digital, the project gains immediate authenticity and credibility.1 It demonstrates the ability to
  translate a genuine business need into a comprehensive technical solution.
  Project Vision: The "Dalenii Publishing Tracker" will be a full-stack web application designed to help an independent author or
   small publisher manage their business. It will allow users to track eBook sales, royalty payments, and advertising se for
  development and a key talking point to demonstrate modern architectural thinking.
  Frontend: A Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript. It will use functional components with Hooks for
  state and lifecycle management. React Router will be used for client-side navigation. UI components will be styled using a
  modern CSS framework or library.
  Backend: A .NET 8 Minimal API. This choice demonstrates proficiency h the latest, most streamlined approach to building APIs in
   C#. The API will expose a set of RESTful endpoints for the React client to consume.
  Data Layer: An Azure SQL Database will serve as the primary relational data store. All database interactions from the API will
  be handled by Entity Framework Core, using the code-first approach to define the schema.
  File Processing: When a user uploads a sales report, the file will be saved to Azure Blob Storage. This upload will trigger an
  Azure Function (via a Blob trigger), which will read the file, parse the CSV data, and use the EF peScript

> questions on the approach outlined in previous prompt to you -- are there open source projects that fulfil some or all of the
  requirements?

✦ Of course. Now that we've outlined the areas to add specificity, the next logical step is to begin defining those details
  together. This will form the core of a detailed design document for the project.


  I suggest we start with the most foundational part: the Functional Requirements (User Stories). By creating a detailed list of
   what the user will do, we can derive all the other technical requirements for the API, database, and UI.

  We have a few example stories already:


   * "As an author, I want to securely sign up and log in..."
   * "As an author, I want to upload a KDP sales report CSV..."
   * "As an author, I want to see a dashboard with my total earnings..."
   * "As an author, I want to manually enter my monthly ad spend..."


  Let's expand on the most important one: the dashboard. This is the first thing the user will see and the primary way they will
   interact with their data.

  To make this more specific, what key pieces of information would be most valuable for an author to see at a glance when they
  first log in? For example, should the main dashboard include:


   1. A list of their top-selling books for the current month?
   2. A clear "Profitability" metric (Total Royalties vs. Total Ad Spend)?
   3. A breakdown of sales by country/marketplace (e.g., Amazon.com vs. Amazon.co.uk)?
   4. A comparison to the previous month's performance (e.g., "Earnings are up 15% from last month")?










































> I'd like to loop back to the original spec, is it related to a CRM or ERP and could it be piggybacked on an existing open
  source system of that sort implemented using our target platforms?

✦ That's an excellent architectural question. Thinking about whether to build a custom solution versus integrating with an
  existing platform is a key part of a specialist's role. Let's break that down.

  1. Is the Project a CRM or ERP?


  First, let's classify the project. While it has elements you might find in a larger system, the "Dalenii Publishing
  Tracker" is most accurately described as a specialized Business Intelligence (BI) or Financial Analytics Dashboard for a
  niche industry (independent publishing).


   * It is not a CRM (Customer Relationship Management), as you are not managing relationships with customers.
   * It has small elements of an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), specifically in the financial tracking and reporting
     modules. However, it's far too focused to be considered a full ERP.


  Its core purpose is to ingest domain-specific data (sales reports, ad spend) and provide tailored insights (profitability,
  sales trends, performance by book).

  2. Could it be Piggybacked on an Open-Source System?

  This is the crucial architectural question: Build vs. Integrate.


  In a real-world corporate project, the answer might be yes. However, for the specific goal of this being a high-impact
  portfolio project designed to showcase your skills, I would strongly advise against building on top of an existing
  open-source ERP/CRM.

  Here is the reasoning behind that recommendation:


   * It Obscures the Skills You Want to Showcase: The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate your ability to design
     and build a modern full-stack application from the database up. If you use a pre-built ERP, the most critical parts—the
     database schema, the core business logic, user management, and the API structure—are already created for you. You would
     spend more time learning the ERP's complex framework than you would writing your own .NET code. A hiring manager would
     not be able to clearly see your ability to architect a system from scratch.


   * It Introduces Massive, Irrelevant Complexity: Open-source ERPs are often huge, complex systems designed for large
     businesses. The overhead of learning, installing, configuring, and customizing one would be immense and would detract
     from your core goal. You would be demonstrating the skill of "customizing an ERP," which is a different career path from
     being a full-stack cloud application developer.


   * The Narrative is More Powerful with a Custom Build: The story of "I identified a real-world business problem and built a
     custom, full-stack cloud-native solution for it from the ground up" is a much more powerful and impressive narrative for a
      portfolio. It allows you to own and explain every line of code and every architectural decision you made, from the data
     model to the CI/CD pipeline. This is exactly what employers are looking for.


  Conclusion:

  While in a different context, leveraging an existing platform would be a valid strategy, it works against the primary
  objective of this project.


  Sticking with your original specification—a custom .NET 8 API, a React frontend, and Azure services—is a far more
  effective approach. It directly demonstrates the specific, high-demand skills you are aiming to showcase and results in a
  more impressive and understandable portfolio piece.
