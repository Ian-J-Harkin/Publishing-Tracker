# Azure Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring the necessary Azure resources to deploy the Publishing Tracker application.

## 1. Create a Resource Group

A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.

1.  **Sign in to the Azure portal.**
2.  In the search bar, type `Resource groups` and select it.
3.  Click **Create**.
4.  Select your subscription, give the resource group a name (e.g., `PublishingTrackerRG`), and choose a region.
5.  Click **Review + create**, then **Create**.

## 2. Create an Azure SQL Database

This will be the production database for the application.

1.  In the Azure portal, search for `SQL databases` and select it.
2.  Click **Create**.
3.  Select the resource group you just created.
4.  Enter a database name (e.g., `PublishingTrackerDB`).
5.  For the server, click **Create new**.
    -   Enter a unique server name, location, and admin credentials.
    -   Click **OK**.
6.  Choose the desired service tier (e.g., `Basic` for development).
7.  Click **Review + create**, then **Create**.
8.  Once the database is created, navigate to it and copy the **Connection string** (ADO.NET). You will need this later.

## 3. Create an Azure Key Vault

This will securely store the application's secrets.

1.  In the Azure portal, search for `Key Vault` and select it.
2.  Click **Create**.
3.  Select your resource group and give the Key Vault a unique name.
4.  Click **Review + create**, then **Create**.
5.  Once created, navigate to the Key Vault and go to **Secrets**.
6.  Click **Generate/Import**.
7.  Give the secret a name (e.g., `DefaultConnection`) and paste the database connection string as the value.
8.  Click **Create**.

## 4. Create Azure App Services

We will create two App Services: one for the backend API and one for the frontend React application.

### Backend App Service

1.  In the Azure portal, search for `App Services` and select it.
2.  Click **Create**.
3.  Select your resource group and give the App Service a unique name (e.g., `PublishingTrackerApi`).
4.  For the runtime stack, select `.NET 8`.
5.  Choose the desired App Service Plan.
6.  Click **Review + create**, then **Create**.

### Frontend App Service

1.  Follow the same steps as above, but give the App Service a different name (e.g., `PublishingTrackerUI`).
2.  For the runtime stack, select `Node.js 20 LTS`.

## 5. Configure App Service to Use Key Vault

Here’s your updated Azure Deployment Guide for the Publishing Tracker application, revised to reflect the latest Azure portal experience and best practices — including changes to authentication, regional availability, and Key Vault integration.

🚀 Azure Deployment Guide (Updated)
This guide walks you through configuring Azure resources for deploying the Publishing Tracker application.

1. Create a Resource Group
A resource group organizes related resources.

Sign in to Azure Portal.

Search for Resource groups.

Click Create.

Select your subscription, name the group (e.g., PublishingTrackerRG), and choose a region (e.g., West Europe or North Europe).

Click Review + create, then Create.

2. Create an Azure SQL Database
This will host your production data.

Search for SQL databases.

Click Create.

Select the resource group you created.

Enter a database name (e.g., PublishingTrackerDB).

Under Server, click Create new:

Enter a unique server name.

Choose a region (note: some regions may be restricted).

Set admin credentials.

Choose Microsoft Entra-only authentication (formerly Azure AD).

Select a pricing tier (e.g., Basic for dev).

Click Review + create, then Create.

After deployment, go to the database and copy the ADO.NET connection string.

3. Create an Azure Key Vault
Used to store secrets securely.

Search for Key Vault.

Click Create.

Select your resource group and name the vault (e.g., PublishingTrackerVault).

Click Review + create, then Create.

After creation, go to Secrets > Generate/Import.

Name the secret (e.g., DefaultConnection) and paste the connection string.

Click Create.

4. Create Azure App Services
You’ll need two App Services: one for the backend API and one for the frontend UI.

🔧 Backend App Service
Search for App Services.

Click Create.

Select your resource group and name it (e.g., PublishingTrackerApi).

Choose runtime stack: .NET 8.

Select an App Service Plan.

Click Review + create, then Create.

🎨 Frontend App Service
Repeat the steps above with:

Name: PublishingTrackerUI

Runtime stack: Node.js 20 LTS

5. Configure App Service to Use Key Vault
Use Key Vault references for secure config.

Go to the backend App Service (PublishingTrackerApi).

Navigate to Settings > Configuration.

Under Application settings, click New application setting.

Name: DefaultConnection

Value:

Code
@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://<your-keyvault-name>.vault.azure.net/secrets/DefaultConnection/<version>)
🔐 Optional: Enable Managed Identity
To avoid storing credentials:

Go to Identity under App Service settings.

Enable System-assigned managed identity.

In Key Vault, grant the identity Secret Reader access.

1.  Navigate to the backend App Service (`PublishingTrackerApi`).
2.  Go to **Settings > Configuration**.
3.  Under **Application settings**, click **New application setting**.
4.  For the name, enter `DefaultConnection`.
5.  For the value, enter `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=YOUR_SECRET_URI)`, replacing `YOUR_SECRET_URI` with the secret identifier from your Key Vault.
6.  Click **OK**, then **Save**.

You have now successfully configured all the necessary Azure resources for deployment. The next step is to set up the CI/CD pipeline.
