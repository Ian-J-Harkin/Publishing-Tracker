# Epic 8: Advanced Analytics - Detailed Implementation Plan

## 1. Backend Development (.NET API)

### Milestone 1: Advanced Analytics Endpoints

- **Task 1.1: Create Year-Over-Year Comparison Endpoint**
  - In `Program.cs`, create a new `GET /api/dashboard/yoy` endpoint.
  - The endpoint should calculate and return a year-over-year comparison of key metrics.

- **Task 1.2: Create Seasonal Performance Endpoint**
  - In `Program.cs`, create a new `GET /api/dashboard/seasonal` endpoint.
  - The endpoint should analyze sales data to identify seasonal trends.

- **Task 1.3: Create Book Performance Endpoint**
  - In `Program.cs`, create a new `GET /api/books/{id}/performance` endpoint.
  - The endpoint should return detailed performance analytics for a specific book.

## 2. Frontend Development (React)

### Milestone 2: Advanced Analytics Components

- **Task 2.1: Develop Advanced Dashboard Components**
  - In `DashboardPage.tsx`, add new components to display the year-over-year and seasonal performance data.
  - Implement a customizable layout using a library like `react-grid-layout`.

- **Task 2.2: Develop Book Performance Page**
  - In `publishing-tracker-ui/src/pages/`, create a new file `BookPerformancePage.tsx`.
  - This component will fetch and display the detailed performance analytics for a specific book.

- **Task 2.3: Implement Export Functionality**
  - In `BookPerformancePage.tsx`, add a button to export the report to a CSV file.
  - Use a library like `react-csv` to handle the CSV generation.

## 3. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Milestone 3: Comprehensive Testing

- **Task 3.1: Backend Integration Tests**
  - Create `AdvancedAnalyticsEndpointsTests.cs` in the test project.
  - Write tests for the new advanced analytics endpoints.

- **Task 3.2: Frontend Unit Tests**
  - Write unit tests for the new advanced analytics components and services.

- **Task 3.3: End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
  - Create a new Cypress test file, `advanced_analytics.cy.ts`.
  - The test will log in, navigate to the dashboard, and interact with the new advanced analytics components.
